Chief Complaint: Acquired absence of the right breast, status post nipple sparing  mastectomy for breast cancer   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Immediate reconstruction of nipple-sparing mastectomy with deep  inferior epigastric perforator flap from the contralateral side,  harvest of pedicle of the flap, and anastomosis of the  thoracodorsal artery and vein (___)    History of Present Illness: Patient is a ___ female with a history of having a  mammogram finding of newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma on the  right breast with a focus of suspicious microinvasion.  She has a history of microinvasive carcinoma of  the right breast diagnosed first in ___ of which she  was found to have been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma  with ER negativity and HER-2/neu positivity.  She has also been  treated with breast conservation surgery as well as  postoperative radiotherapy. She is now here for planned  mastectomy for breast cancer to be followed by desired immediate  breast reconstruction.

She tolerated  the procedure well.  Neuro: The patient received morphine PCA with good effect and  adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient  was transitioned to oral pain medications.    CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;  vital signs were routinely monitored.   Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;  vital signs were routinely monitored.   GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until  tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when appropriate,  which was tolerated well. She was also started on a bowel  regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on POD#2.  Intake and output were closely monitored.   ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV cefazolin.  The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of  infection.   Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during  this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as  possible.

You may have constipation when taking  narcotic pain medications (oxycodone, percocet, vicodin,  hydrocodone, dilaudid, etc.); you should continue drinking  fluids, you may take stool softeners, and should eat foods that  are high in fiber. * ___ nursing services will help you with JP drain care.

You are also anemic. We think this is related to your cancer but  should have this followed up as an outpatient. You have several  abnormalities on your lab values that we would like to manage  while you are in the hospital but since you want to go home, you  should have lab work done as an outpatient to follow up your  liver enzymes, uric acid, and LDH.

History of Present Illness: The patient is a very pleasant, ___ female who has a  past medical and past surgical history significant for right  breast carcinoma and status post mastectomy.She developed a left  breast carcinoma in ___ underwent lumpectomy followed by  radiation therapy. In ___ developed another left breast  carcinoma and this was excised with wide local excision under  wide localexcision only protocol.She recently developed a new  diagnosis of left breast invasive ductal carcinoma,grade 2, ER  positive, HER-2/neu negative. We discussed surgical options for  management to be mastectomy. We discussed we would perform a  sentinel lymph node biopsy after the discussion at  multidisciplinary tumor conference. We offered reconstructive  options, however, the patient did not wish to pursue these. Of  note, she is a Jehovah Witness and reports that she would not  receive blood products even if they would be lifesaving.   Therefore, we elected to proceed with a left breast total mastectomy, left axillary sentinel lymph node  biopsy, possible axillary lymph node dissection. Risks,  benefits, and alternatives of the aforementioned surgical plan  were discussed with the patient.  She voiced understanding and wished to proceed.The patient signed informed  consent for the procedure.
